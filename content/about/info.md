Born and raised in Turkey, my higher education started in 2009 at Cemal Şaşmaz High School in Ankara. After high school, I took a 4-year undergraduate degree and majored in Languages (English and Turkish). I have always been a determined and hardworking student, and this approach to education has led to my grades averaging 90%, even in my last year. Furthermore, my time-management and organisational skills have highly developed due to me getting involved in several projects during high school.  
  
One of the major projects that I had taken up was organizing my school’s orientation for the welcoming of the new students. Additionally, I joined the Comenius Project in Romania, which aimed to raise environmental awareness among young people. I was also involved in the volleyball school team, which required up to four hours of training every day. This forced me to become a highly disciplined person and learn to meticulously manage my time.  
In the following year, I started my Bachelor’s Degree in American Studies at Ankara University. I chose to minor in English Studies, which has allowed me to gain a broader understanding of English works, literature, culture, history and language. Further, to widen my horizon and get experience, I regularly take part in extracurricular activities related to my field of studies. For example, in May 2013, I participated in the MUN at Fatih University, and in EUROsimA simulation at Middle East Technical University in 2016. These two events added political background to my academic knowledge.  
  
I arrived at TU Chemnitz in Germany, as an Erasmus student from Turkey. After a semester there, I decided to continue my education in this country. In order to get accepted to TU Chemnitz full time, I took German courses and achieved C1 German level after three semesters. At the same time, I continued studying English and American Studies at the university as a freelance exchange student, and commuted from Chemnitz to Berlin every weekend for work.  
  
After three semesters of hard work, I finished my bachelor’s degree in the summer semester of 2020. Finally, this semester, I have started my Master’s Degree in English Literatures at Humboldt University of Berlin.
